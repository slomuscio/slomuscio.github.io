      <description>**I am a second year graduate student in the Physics Department at the University of Virginia. I work with Dr. Kent Yagi studying the nature of black holes and gravity.
I received my Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics with a concentration in Astronomy from the New Jersey Institute of Technology in 2020, where I worked with Dr. Bin Chen to understand the mechanism behind particle acceleration in the solar atmosphere during flares and coronal mass ejections.</description>

      <description>Current Work Regularizing Parameterized Kerr Spacetime  University of Virginia Department of Physics
Graduate Researcher
Advisor: Dr. Kent Yagi
 The goal of this project is to refine a general, asymptotically flat parameterized-Kerr metric preserving Kerr symmetries. This parameterized spacetime exhibited pathologies, such as non-physical divergences, in some cases. By employing new expansions, I was able to remedy these unwanted behaviors. In addition, I test the parameterized metricâ€™s ability to recover various beyond-General Relativity theories and quantify its ability to do so via a root-mean-square error analysis.</description>

      <description>As a Graduate StatLab Associate, I work with my colleagues to provide free statistical/data science resources to the UVA community and beyond. These include free articles, consultations, and workshops.
Articles Specifically, I have written two articles. The first is Getting Started with the Kruskal-Wallis Test which outlines what the Kruskal-Wallis test is and walks the reader through how to do the test by hand and with Python. The second article is Logistic Regression Four Ways with Python which gives a quick overview of Logistic Regression and then walks the reader through performing the test four different ways with Python.</description>
